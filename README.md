# Robot Dream

This repository allows to train DREAMER a strong Model Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agent using NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
On top of providing a DREAMER wrapper for Isaac, we also provide a Buoyancy plugin that allows to simulate hydrodynamic effects.
This plugin is a port of the UUV simulator, a well establish plugin in gazebo community to simulate the behaviors of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) as well as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).
